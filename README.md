# INTRODUCTION #
Travelers often find themselves without an easy way to tote around the luggage that they need on a trip. While luggage can be left in a hotel room, this frequently isn’t an option before check-in or after check out especially as more and more people opt for non-traditional accommodations that don’t always provide the amenities hotels do. Additionally, luggage can be safely left in a locked car, but many travelers in major cities don’t rent cars. Have you ever checked out of a hotel and still had to spend some time in the city? Did you ever wonder how easier the stay would be if you could store your luggage safely near you?
This App give travelers who don’t have alternative options a way to safely stow their luggage so that they don’t have to carry it with them. With this app you can have your bags only when you want them – this app will take care of them when you don’t. This is Luggage storage network that connects travelers with local businesses (shops, cafes, hotels etc.) across the country. Our platform allows travelers to leave their bags/boxes with a local shop near them and enjoy the city without having to lug around their heavy bags when all they should be doing is living hands free life.
